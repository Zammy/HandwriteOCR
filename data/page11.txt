in improving business performance. Employees appreciate knowing what 
they are doing well and where they can improve. Managers should 
offer feedback regularly, not only during annual reviews. Short, 
constructive conversations help build trust and encourage 
continuous growth. When feedback is delivered respectfully, 
it strengthens relationships and supports better teamwork.
Another area worth attention is time management. Many teams
lose hours each week due to unclear priorities or unnecessary meetings. 
By reviewing the weekly schedule and removing low‑value 
activities, a team can free up time for more meaningful work. 
Setting aside focused work periods, where interruptions are 
minimized, can also increase efficiency. Customer communication 
is equally important. Whether the customer is an external 
client or an internal partner, timely responses and clear explanations
help maintain strong relationships. Even when a full answer 
is not yet available, a brief update shows that the request is 
being handled. This simple habit can prevent misunderstandings.
