on parchment that curled unpredictably at the edges, as if resisting 
linguistic ornamentation. A zoologist described the peculiar gait 
of a nocturnal rodent that allegedly navigated using faint magnetic 
cues. A clockmaker, hunched over a velvet mat, examined 
a minuscule gear under magnification, searching for microscopic 
imperfections that might disrupt its rhythmic fidelity.
A sculptor in a paint‑stained apron debated the philosophical 
implications of asymmetry while chiseling a block of 
alabaster that emitted a chalky perfume. A horticulturist 
transplanted a stubborn fern whose fronds drooped 
theatrically whenever exposed to abrupt temperature changes. 
A sociologist, sipping lukewarm tea, mapped conversational 
patterns among commuters waiting for a delayed tram. Finally, 
a wandering illustrator paused to sketch a lamppost whose 
elongated shadow resembled a question mark, unaware 
that a street vendor behind him was arranging jars of 
iridescent spices into a perfectly symmetrical spiral.
