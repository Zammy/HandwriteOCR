Finally, a traveling illustrator sketched a staircase that looped back 
into its own shadow, claiming it was the most cooperative 
architectural feature he had ever met. A quiet traveller 
walked along a narrow path, carrying a small notebook filled 
with half‑finished ideas. A friendly baker waved from her 
shop window, proud of a new loaf that rose higher than 
any she had made before. Nearby, a young gardener checked 
the soil around a row of seedlings, hoping the cool morning 
air would help them grow stronger. A painter set up an 
easel beside a fountain, trying to capture the way sunlight 
danced on the water. A curious child watched, asking 
simple questions about colors and shadows. Across the street, 
a bus driver practiced smooth turns in an empty parking lot, 
determined to make every ride comfortable. A librarian 
opened the doors of a quiet reading room, arranging chairs 
so visitors could sit wherever they felt most at ease.
At the end of the day, a tired musician hummed a soft tune, 
letting the calm evening settle around him.
